When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.

The hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.

I would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.",uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA,5,2016-07-12,0,0

Pros:
Great location- you're right by the train station, central location to get to old town and new town, and right by sight seeing his tours. Food, bars, and shopping all within walking distance. Location, location, location.
Very clean and very good maid service

Cons:
Tiny rooms 
Uncomfortable bed 
Absolutely no amenities 
No phone in room 
No wardrobe 

Was given a lot of attitude about me and my husband sharing a room which was quite strange and we were charged 15 pounds more for double occupancy not sure why that matters I felt like it was a money grab. It was just handled in a kind of odd manner to me...

0,AXgRULmWcME7J6Ix3I--ww,ne5WhI1jUFOcRn-b-gAzHA,"Mittlerweile gibt es in Edinburgh zwei Ableger der Motel-One-Kette - diese hier ist eher das schlechtere.

Wir hatten auf unserer Schottlandtour die Gelegenheit beide Ableger kennenzulernen, da wir beide Nächte in Edinburgh (am ersten sowie am letzten Tag) in einem der beiden Motel One's verbrachten. Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht.

Das Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.
Unser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen.
Sonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.

Im gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte.

Die Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.

Das Frühstück für 9,50 GBP / Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.

Für ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen.

They are very helpful and have a lot of patience answering all my questions about where to go etc. there is also a lounge open 24 hours with snack-type food. Breakfast is continental-style so if you want heartier fare look elsewhere though you don't have to go far. The bus and train stations are right across the street so it's easy access to the airport or anywhere else you may want to go. Turn uphill to old town or cross the bridge to new town. The room with a view i got was spacious and comfortable though it's a bit of a maze to find it-just follow the signs. The windows are double paned so the room is quiet plus i was on the 5th floor which helps. It's a bit pricey but still one of the best values i found!,uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA,4,2016-08-21,0,0

Firstly they don't have any twin rooms in the hotel which would be preferable when I was sharing with a friend not my lover! There is only one small bin which is located in the bathroom.  No soap, which I find ridiculous, only toiletries were a dual shower gel/hair wash. There was a hairdryer but no wardrobes or drawers. Room was also very cold. 

Now for the positive, the location is very good, close to princes street and St. Andrews square. The staff are very helpful and the bar is 24 hours. 

Don't bother with the breakfast which is £9.50 each for a continental breakfast where you can easily get a cooked breakfast in any one of the cafes in Cockburn Street, which is adjacent to this hotel.

Motel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.

Location is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.

My room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. 

Random: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used. And one of the best dryers in general-called a Black Mambo. It was worth staying there for that alone.

Staff were all friendly and welcoming, presentable and professional.
We received a room upgrade with quite a large room overlooking the bridge crossing Waverley station to Princes St. Despite overlooking a busy road, the room was almost silent thanks to solid double glazing. The room temperature was perfectly controlled with an individual A/C unit. Super clean, modern, uncluttered. Bathroom was similar. No slamming doors or noise in the night. Bonus.

Free wifi that works with one log in (doesn't require repeated log ins as some places do) and had decent signal strength.

The buffet continental breakfast was also a hit with fresh croissants, danishes, cold cuts, cheese, toast, fruit and yoghurt all well presented, fresh and good quality as was the coffee.

On entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. Wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct Scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel.

I sat in One Lounge, had tea and food self served for well under £10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. With a copy of local newspaper in hand I really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons I came in.

Some hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in German. On going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck.

Hmmm, by the time this was all done I came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot Earl Grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea. Great place though nice breakfast and funky decor especially the plasma tv displaying a roasting log fire in reception, but sadly for me no easy access to wifi when badly required.

With that said I've always had pretty good experiences with Pei Wei, the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in MSG offered by some of the local chinese restaurants.  the portions are good sized, the food is generally consistent, and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare I say it's name ""panda express"" (which is overpriced crap)

the time before last that I went they forgot the tomato's and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered, I didn't discover that the dressing was missing until I got home, I immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)

I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially ""un-F$@k's"" your food and returns it to you.

I've tried a variety of Chinese restaurants, this doesn't taste close to anything I've had at other Asian restaurants. Their Mongolian beef  was 5 pieces of beef and large mushrooms cut into thirds in a thick sauce. You eat the rice to wash off the nasty flavor. My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering  sauce as well.  I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish.  The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price.  This was not worth it to us.

I love being able to just say ""same as last time"" when I call it in. Not as good as PF Changs, but certainly better than most other Asian-ish places in Surprise. Be aware that they use shitake mushrooms is almost everything, but they are fine with custom orders if you don't want them. All in all, it's not my favorite place, but I always enjoy it every time.",jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,4,2009-06-25,2,1

We discovered the Surprise location a couple weeks ago and decided that tonight we would grab a quick bite. The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my ""tried and true"" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken."" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever!

Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...

As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. 

Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise! (or they have a patio you can dine from)",jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,4,2008-10-06,0,0

We get there and I sit waiting for the food until 8! Nobody acted like it was a big deal when I told them and just said ""oh.... Well we are running behind."" Um okay?! We get home and they forgot to put the crab puffs in my bag. Didn't bother going back and moved on to our meals. My honey glazed chicken was average, edible. My husbands sweet and sour chicken was so soggy it was disgusting! Couldn't even eat it. My daughter loves fried rice and wouldn't even eat hers, it was so greasy. We all ended up eating PB&J's and it was 100x better than anything we brought home.",jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,1,2014-04-22,0,0

We were served quickly and the staff was friendly! The restaurant was clean and tables were bussed quickly. 
I was disappointed with my Mongolian chicken. It tasted more like Teriyaki and was swimming in sauce. I had at least a 1/3 cup of sauce left on my plate after eating my food.
All in all, PeiWei's food will be why I don't return anytime soon even though their staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere.",jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,2,2014-10-01,0,0

They consistently screw up on orders, have huge wait times, and run out of key ingredients on an alarmingly regular basis. We just spent an hour waiting for a take out order (kung pao veggies and vegetable fried rice), which was twice the time they quoted us, only to be told they were out of WHITE RICE (how does a chinese restaurant fail to foresee the possibility that they might serve a lot of white rice on a Saturday night?!). I may have chosen to stick around the extra 15 minutes if they hadn't already had to re-make half my order after making it incorrectly the first time. When I change up an order even slightly to accommodate for allergies/dietary needs, they have to re-make it at least 75% of the time.
If the food was consistently delicious, I'd rate it higher, but honestly, it's only okay.",jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,2,2016-02-14,0,0
